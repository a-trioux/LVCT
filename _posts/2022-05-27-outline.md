The tutorial lasts for 3 hours and follows the outline presented below:

● Part I (25mn): Introduction <br>
&nbsp; o More and More challenging application contexts <br>
&nbsp; o Current challenges (High Video quality, Low Latency, Mobility) <br>
&nbsp; o Classical solutions/mechanisms for these use-cases <br>
&nbsp; o Alternative: Towards a graceful degradation with LVCT <br>
&nbsp; o Outline of the tutorial 

● Part II (95mn): Baseline LVCT scheme: SoftCast <br>
&nbsp; o Introduction: Issues with conventional digital schemes <br>
&nbsp; o Detailed description of the SoftCast LVCT architecture <br>
&nbsp; o Quality analysis of the LVCT architectures <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ▪ Theoretical analysis <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ▪ Introduction of the visual artifacts <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ▪ Video quality evaluation <br>
&nbsp; o Main variants of the SoftCast LVCT solution

● Break (~15min)

● Part III (20mn): SDR-based Hardware implementations <br>
&nbsp; o From simulation to real implementation <br>
&nbsp; o Current implementation and issues

● Part IV (25mn): Current research challenges <br>
&nbsp; o Improving the coding efficiency (towards hybrid digital-analog schemes) <br>
&nbsp; o Reducing the latency <br>
&nbsp; o Channel adaptation
